# _Portulaca amilis_ genome annotation: genomic architecture of carbon concentrating mechanisms

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. This main goal of this project is production of a high quality annotation of the recently sequenced [_Portulaca amilis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portulaca_amilis) genome. Secondary goals include characterizing gene family expansion of key photosynthetic genes (e.g. [PEPC](http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PEPcase#wpContent0)) and comparing these gene families to other C3, C4, and CAM genomes.

## Goals

1. Annoting the _P. amilis_ genome
2. Characterizing PEPC gene family expansion
3. Comparing PEPC gene family expansion to publicly available $C_3$, $C_4$, and CAM genomes

## The data

1. _P. amilis_ genome sequenced and assembled by Dovetail Genomics
    * `.fasta`
2. _P. amilis_ transcriptome (1kP)
3. PEPC alignments
4. Genomes for
    * Orchid
    * Kalanchoe
    * Pineapple
    * Maize
    * Beta
    * Saguero?

## Results


## Assessment

Use MAKER quality assessment tools (AED, specificity, accuracy, etc.).
Was it successful in achieving the initial goal?
