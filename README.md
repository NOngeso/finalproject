# _Portulaca amilis_ genome annotation: genomics of carbon concentrating mechanisms

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. This main goal of this project is production of a high quality annotation of the recently sequenced [_Portulaca amilis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portulaca_amilis) genome. Secondary goals include characterizing gene family expansion of key photosynthetic genes (e.g. [PEPC](http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PEPcase#wpContent0)) and comparing these gene families to other C3, C4, and CAM genomes.

## Goals

1. Annoting the _P. amilis_ genome
2. Characterizing PEPC gene family expansion
3. Comparing PEPC gene family expansion to publicly available C3, C4, and CAM genomes

## The data

1. _P. amilis_ genome
    * Source: Edwards Lab, sequenced and assembled by Dovetail Genomics
    * Format: `.fasta`
    * Status: ~418Mbp assembled into 11 scaffolds analogous to the 11 _P. amilis_ chromosomes
2. _P. amilis_ transcriptome
    * Source: reference ID [ERR2040261](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/ERR2040261)
    * Format: `.fasta`
    * Status: raw reads, **need to be assembled**
3. PEPC alignments
    * Source: Edwards Lab and [1KP Initiative](https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/onekp/)
    * Format: `.fasta`
    * Status:
4. Genomes for
    * Orchid
    * Kalanchoewiki
    * Pineapple
    * Maize
    * Beta
    * Saguero?

## Methods

While methodology is in flux refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/isgilman/finalproject/wiki/Step-by-step-genome-annotation-for-Portulaca-amilis).

## Results


## Assessment

Use MAKER quality assessment tools (AED, specificity, accuracy, etc.).

Need to flesh this out more
